Everything in javascript happens inside an "execution context".

Execution context
{
  it has two components
  {
    1. memory component(variable environment): stores variables and functions as key value pairs.
    2. code component(thread of execution): whole code is executed one line at a time.
  }
}

javascript is a synchronus single-threaded language.
