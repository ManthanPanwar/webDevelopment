Axios is an HTTP library or HTTP client to make request to either your own backend third party API to fetch data and 
it is similar to the fetch API which is built into the browser but Axios is more powerful and has better syntax and you
can also use it with nodeJS.

Axios returns a promise so you can either you .then() or async await.

Axios is just a tool for you to communicate from your frontend to the backend.
