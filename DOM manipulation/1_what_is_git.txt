GIT is distributed version control system

git is an independent software.
github, bitbucket, gitlab are just UI providers

Q. How to tell git who are you?
{
  go to terminal, then write
  {
    git config --global user.name "ManthanPanwar"
    git config --global user.email "manthandpr@gmail.com"
  }
}

=> repository is like a directory.
